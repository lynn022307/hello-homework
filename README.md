# Git
  Git is a version control tools. I think that is a way to control your code writing history some body will use it to control the release version. For the full description please check [here](https://git-scm.com/).

  Then we gonna learn the command below:

  1. <b>commit</b>: to `do` the command
  2. <b>branch</b>: different `version` of codes.
  3. <b>merge</b>: to `combine` `old` codes and `new` codes.
  4. <b>rebase</b>: an `alternative` way to `merge`
  5. <b>diff</b>: give `diff` to see what's changed.

### Question:
  1. Define difference between rebase and merge ? sometimes merge directly into master file can be disaster because someone may have merge his branch there. Better try rebase? (according to gooogle: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)

  2. What is a conflict ? When merging branches, there may be some error. They call it conflict
  3. When do I need a commit ? When your new codes are ready to update the old ones.

# Linux
  Linux is an Open source OS as you know like MacOS, Windows ... so on. So why linux ? Linux can give us a full support to manage our program language ,security protect and resource control.

  Then we gonna learn the command below:

  1. <b>ls</b>: list directory contents, including file `name`, `contents` inside.
  2. <b>cat</b>: to `print` file
  3. <b>rm</b>: to `remove` a file or a category
  4. <b>cat</b>: to view
  5. <b>echo</b>: to print or to show the file name, but the contents are not included.
  6. <b>bash_profile</b>: my user profile

### Question:
  1. How do I define a question ? A question is something I don't know yet, but there's an standard `answer` to it.

  2. How can I solve the problem in Linux ? `problem` sounds like a `bug`? first i need to know what's normal(or standard) to know what's the problem. if there's a error reminder, i will ask Lucas. Thank you Lucas!

  3. What is good and bad in Linux ?
  4. What is Terminal ? somewhere you can make `changes` to a computer by giving `command lines`
